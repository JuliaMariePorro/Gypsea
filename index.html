                <span>I feel like I'm just surviving every day,</span>
                <span>hoping it ends, so it feels like I start living life again.</span>
                <span>When you miss home, where do you go?</span>
                <span>Is there any place I won't feel alone?</span>
                <span>I want to shift from this world,</span>
                <span>I want to matter to me.</span>
                <span>Stuck, lost, waiting to see,</span>
                <span>When this will be.</span>
                <span>My future has liability.</span>
                <span>It really feels like too much.</span>
                <span>Weighing me down, it's all so corrupt.</span>
                <span>Will the hurt end, am I capable of escaping this trend?</span>
                <span>I never want to mirror this again.</span>
                <span>Full of emptiness,</span>
                <span>I feel the absence so deeply,</span>
                <span>My heart is POURING out its PLEADING.</span>
                <span>For something so unsure,</span>
                <span>What is life's meaning??</span>
                <span>Hard to decipher my needing.</span>
                <span>It's rain and thunder alike.</span>
                <span>Trying not to worry tonight.</span>
                <span>I'll take the next flight,</span>
                <span>When this storm ends,</span>
                <span>This version I'll never want to see again.</span>

                <span>Stillness awakened, with a life of its own,</span>
                <span>We've found a new purpose, and our hearts have grown.</span>
                <span>I feel each ripple, each subtle sway,</span>
                <span>Your presence makes my heart want to stay.</span>

                <span>Should've braced for the end of our day.</span>
                <span>My hope in the tide, once strong and bright,</span>
                <span>Faded as moments slipped from sight.</span>
                <span>Bound by a thread that couldn't withstand,</span>
                <span>The fleeting moments we had planned.</span>
                <span>Reaching for you when you drifted afar,</span>
                <span>Without that thread, we're lost like a distant star.</span>
                <span>What if you glimpse a new light in your sky,</span>
                <span>And cut the thread to chase a new high?</span>
                <span>We've swum too far, lost from what we both knew,</span>
                <span>She'll find her way to shore more quickly than I do,</span>
                <span>A clear sky, and you're gone from my sight,</span>
                <span>I wait for the clouds, to imagine you back drawn in light.</span>
                <span>The day turns to dreams, to cope with your leave,</span>
                <span>With a glance at the wave, my heart starts to grieve.</span>
