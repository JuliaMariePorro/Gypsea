                <span>A string of meaningless letters,</span>

                <span>A presence lasting as long as my life,</span>
                <span>To remember the word,</span>
                <span>To catch the echo of it, spoken to me,</span>
                <span>Reliving the moment my ears first embraced it,</span>
                <span>It stirs my body,</span>
                <span>A new awareness,</span>
                <span>The weight of my own mortality,</span>
                <span>How can a word,</span>
                <span>Give me life,</span>
                <span>How can a word,</span>

                <span>In the midst of an abundance of free choices.</span>
                <span>I choose experience.</span>
                <span>The ability to live out all my life’s old questions.</span>
                <span>Ohhhhh the unanswered.</span>
                <span>How it lingers on my mind.</span>
                <span>It’s the smell of a faint perfume from the life of someone walking by.</span>
                <span>The subtle stir of our senses, anticipating rain.</span>
                <span>Passing by melodies of an old song reviving forgotten words.</span>
                <span>Remnants of dew on lashes, painting over the sorrow once poured out.</span>
                <span>Prints in the sand leading me back to where I was before I came to the ocean.</span>
                <span>Stains on my favorite t-shirt from dinners we cooked when I fell in love.</span>
                <span>The placement of the books on my shelf that your eyes so intentionally ordered.</span>
                <span>A mark on the wall from the first time the door opened too hard.</span>
                <span>A yearly addition to a collection of existential crisis when I gaze at the sky.</span>
                <span>The knowledge of life you shared,</span>
                <span>this life that is ever changing, or some let go and lost,</span>
                <span>our lives that I had loved to live and to know,</span>
                <span>but understand it haunts me when that life became,</span>
                <span>JUST a photo, a memory, a passage in this book.</span>
                <span>What if we lived out our days,</span>
                <span>What would a life of an abundance of you and I look like?</span>
                <span>What if my mom and I didn’t fight? And my family was alright?</span>
                <span>What would “you” even look like?</span>
                <span>Would you treat me right?</span>
                <span>Does that even matter, does that change the intensity of this light?</span>
                <span>The only way to know is answer and experience all of my old questions.</span>
                <span>And I do it every night.</span>
                <span>The answer is that there are. So many answers that it doesn’t even matter,</span>
                <span>To keep living is the rewrite.</span>
                <span>I love it when you cross my mind.</span>
                <span>I love it when my mind crosses more you’s.</span>
                <span>The room is filled with revolving choices, people, pictures, memories...</span>
                <span>The book to be forever unfinished and continuously edited.</span>

                <span>How it feels to feel this low.</span>
                <span>Dependent on the depth of the abyss you’ve drilled into my heart?</span>
                <span>Cleared aisles of identity and stories inside of me and took it to fill up some aimless shopping cart.</span>
                <span>(lol)</span>
                <span>The holes you forgot to fill, you left me empty, you left abruptly. It aches sweetheart.</span>
                <span>Losing the intricacies to explain how heartbreak feels is a sign of my depart.</span>
                <span>Waiting and wondering when life without you starts.</span>
                <span>Grateful when the nuances fade into old data, “what I liked and didn't" pretty flow chart.</span>
                <span>But before that happens, the smell of your perfume paints the air around my days like fine art.</span>
                <span>Straight to my heart.</span>
                <span>Recounting the memories replaying, re-feeling moments I loved, overusing the button to restart.</span>
                <span>Straight to my heart.</span>
                <span>Closing my eyes to stare into yours, seeing them soft as glowing stars & intensely gaze at me like a dart.</span>
                <span>Straight to my heart.</span>
                <span>With hesitation and intention.. music, photos, time. shared. Oh so devine. Feels like the first time a taste so unique so tart.</span>
                <span>Straight to my heart.</span>
                <span>I taught you how to ride that bike again, I thought the muscle memory came back for me, I liked that part.</span>
                <span>Straight to my heart.</span>
                <span>It did come back though, all the feelings, you remembered how to fall - in love. But turns out I’m not that smart.</span>
                <span>Straight to my heart.</span>
                <span>It wasn’t for me, it was rekindled for an old love, and I watch you take the best of us and give it to her, from your life I depart.</span>
                <span>A dagger,</span>
                <span>Straight to my heart.</span>

                <span>but I’m 20 meters down, lost and drowned.  </span>
                <span>I hear the words, but I see their game,  </span>
                <span>the way they speak, and what they claim.</span>

                <span>A battle rages, between my heart and mind.</span>
                <span>The age-old clash, my soul lives intertwined.</span>
                <span>Is it true that more pain holds more worth?</span>
                <span>How do you balance logic and intense emotional turf?</span>

                <span>How do you wipe the smear, the stain,</span>
                <span>to make peace for us both and ease the pain? </span>
                <span>To accept needs, to empathize,</span>

                <span>though I’m torn and bruised within, </span>

                <span>Love, passion it makes no sense,  </span>
                <span>A mystery that’s so intense.  </span>
                <span>With time, I unwrap gifts of moments ive treasured,  </span>
                <span>it’s not the things I love, but devouring seconds decadently measured—  </span>
                <span>A universe that can’t be named, </span>
                <span>no reason for it, yet it repeatedly curates all the same.  </span>
                <span>Why are some meant to stay, some go,  </span>
                <span>to live within us but never physically show?  </span>
                <span>I close my eyes and there you are,  </span>
                <span>A movie of us, a star, though, i'll never see again.  </span>
                <span>I can’t escape, I can’t forget,  </span>
                <span>the life we had, the life we felt.  </span>
                <span>But love needs action, trust needs proof, </span>
                <span>Sorry requires change, to heal the truth. </span>
                <span>Ive learned, though, love and care can’t show,</span>
                <span>unless you know how they can accept your glow.</span>
                <span>You have to learn them and act accordingly,</span>
                <span>or else care comes off as disrespect, unfortunately.</span>
                <span>We are kindred spirits, us two.</span>
                <span>Yet eons since I’ve seen you,</span>
                <span>I travel back to yesterdays,</span>
                <span>for how could I forget your voice, I say?</span>
                <span> </span>

far away from me you’ll stay</span>

                <h2>PURGATORY OF A LOST SOUL.</h2>
                <span>I am weakened, I am vulnerable</span>
                <span>My darkest parts are now audible.</span>
                <span>I used to not understand,</span> 
                <span>why people weren't happy on land.</span>
                <span>I heard death's gossip all around me.</span>
                <span>I didn't get it, that thought never crossed me.</span>
                <span>Today I do.</span>
                <span>Haunted by giving in,</span> 
                <span>saying goodbye to the lovely blue.</span>
                <span>I've joined the lost souls in their suffering.</span>
                <span>The blind trust in "it'll pass"</span>
                <span>needs to mean something.</span>

                <h2>STUCK, FULL OF EMPTY.</h2>
                <span>I feel like I'm just surviving every day,</span>
                <span>hoping it ends, so it feels like I start living life again.</span>
                <span>When you miss home, where do you go?</span>
                <span>Is there any place I won't feel alone?</span>
                <span>I want to shift from this world,</span>
                <span>I want to matter to me.</span>
                <span>Stuck, lost, waiting to see,</span>
                <span>When this will be.</span>
                <span>My future has liability.</span>
                <span>It really feels like too much.</span>
                <span>Weighing me down, it's all so corrupt.</span>
                <span>Will the hurt end, am I capable of escaping this trend?</span>
                <span>I never want to mirror this again.</span>
                <span>Full of emptiness,</span>
                <span>I feel the absence so deeply,</span>
                <span>My heart is POURING out its PLEADING.</span>
                <span>For something so unsure,</span>
                <span>What is life's meaning??</span>
                <span>Hard to decipher my needing.</span>
                <span>It's rain and thunder alike.</span>
                <span>Trying not to worry tonight.</span>
                <span>I'll take the next flight,</span>
                <span>When this storm ends,</span>
                <span>This version I'll never want to see again.</span>
