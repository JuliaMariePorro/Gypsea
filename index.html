                <span>I feel like I'm just surviving every day,</span>
                <span>hoping it ends, so it feels like I start living life again.</span>
                <span>When you miss home, where do you go?</span>
                <span>Is there any place I won't feel alone?</span>
                <span>I want to shift from this world,</span>
                <span>I want to matter to me.</span>
                <span>Stuck, lost, waiting to see,</span>
                <span>When this will be.</span>
                <span>My future has liability.</span>
                <span>It really feels like too much.</span>
                <span>Weighing me down, it's all so corrupt.</span>
                <span>Will the hurt end, am I capable of escaping this trend?</span>
                <span>I NEVER want to mirror this again.</span>
                <span>FULL of emptiness,</span>
                <span>I feel the absence SO deeply,</span>
                <span>My heart is POURING out its PLEADING.</span>
                <span>For something so unsure,</span>
                <span>What the fuck is the meaning??</span>
                <span>Hard to decipher my needing.</span>
                <span>It's rain and thunder alike.</span>
                <span>Trying not to worry tonight.</span>
                <span>I'll take the next flight,</span>
                <span>When this storm ends,</span>
                <span>This version I'll never see again.</span>

                <span>My darkest parts are now audible.</span>
                <span>I used to not understand why people weren't happy on land.</span>
                <span>I heard death's gossip all around me.</span>
                <span>I didn't get it, that thought never crossed me.</span>
                <span>Today I do.</span>
                <span>Haunted by giving in, saying goodbye to the lovely blue.</span>
                <span>I've joined the lost souls in their suffering.</span>
                <span>The blind trust in "it'll pass" needs to mean something.</span>
