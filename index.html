                <h2>STUCK, FULL OF EMPTY. 7-11-2024</h2>
                <span>I feel like I'm just surviving every day,</span>
                <span>hoping it ends, so it feels like I start living life again.</span>
                <span>When you miss home, where do you go?</span>
                <span>Is there any place I won't feel alone?</span>
                <span>I want to shift from this world,</span>
                <span>I want to matter to me.</span>
                <span>Stuck, lost, waiting to see,</span>
                <span>When this will be.</span>
                <span>My future has liability.</span>
                <span>It really feels like too much.</span>
                <span>Weighing me down, it's all so corrupt.</span>
                <span>Will the hurt end, am I capable of escaping this trend?</span>
                <span>I never want to mirror this again.</span>
                <span>Full of emptiness,</span>
                <span>I feel the absence so deeply,</span>
                <span>My heart is POURING out its PLEADING.</span>
                <span>For something so unsure,</span>
                <span>What is life's meaning??</span>
                <span>Hard to decipher my needing.</span>
                <span>It's rain and thunder alike.</span>
                <span>Trying not to worry tonight.</span>
                <span>I'll take the next flight,</span>
                <span>When this storm ends,</span>
                <span>This version I'll never want to see again.</span>

                <span>I am weakened, I am vulnerable</span>
                <span>My darkest parts are now audible.</span>
                <span>I used to not understand,</span> 
                <span>why people weren't happy on land.</span>
                <span>I heard death's gossip all around me.</span>
                <span>I didn't get it, that thought never crossed me.</span>
                <span>Today I do.</span>
                <span>Haunted by giving in,</span> 
                <span>saying goodbye to the lovely blue.</span>
                <span>I've joined the lost souls in their suffering.</span>
                <span>The blind trust in "it'll pass"</span>

                <span>A tale that needs to be understood?</span>
                <span>How can you tell when it's YOU who should?</span>

                <span>Pierced by love, never-ending bleeding.</span>

                <span>Amidst living in so much strife,</span>

                <span>The endless quest,</span>
                <span>To find this big heart at peace, at rest.</span>

                <h2>WADING, WAITING. 7-29-2024</h2>
                <span>The ocean is a desert, and there ain't much in it.</span>
                <span>You came in, the horizon turned velvet,</span>
                <span>A new sky lit.</span>
                <span>The stillness came to life.</span>
                <span>We've created a new purpose to life.</span>
                <span>I can feel now every ripple, the ocean's tiny movements.</span>
                <span>I like you to wade in my presence.</span>
                <span>It is cruel, though, to be aware of the seconds.</span>
                <span>You'll foresee the deadend,</span>
                <span>I noticed the drift, before you moved away.</span>
                <span>I could have prepared myself for this day.</span>
                <span>My persiting hope in the push and pull did'nt want to end.</span>
                <span>We'd always be attached to our invisible thread.</span>
                <span>Reaching for the string to pull you in when you float too far.</span>
                <span>Without it, we'll forever be apart.</span>
                <span>What if she's caught a glance at a different star.</span>
                <span>She'd have to cut it to travel those parts.</span>
                <span>We've swam out too far.</span>
                <span>And she'll figure out how to ride to shore faster than me.</span>
                <span>I'll be left out at sea, just me.</span>
                <span>A clear sky, and your'e gone.</span>
                <span>Now I wait for the clouds to come in,</span>
                <span>so I can see you again, beautifully drawn</span>
                <span>The day becomes a dream, to cope for when you leave.</span>
                <span>With one glance she reads that wave,</span>
                <span>my green eyed babe.</span>
                <span>Time to day dream from dusk till dawn,</span>
                <span>until I have strength to keep wading along.</span>

                <span>My writing focused on loss and despair,</span>
                <span>my mind all-consumed, obsessed, too emotionally aware.</span>
                <span>Its my perverse form of gratitude,</span>
                <span>for moments I once had.</span>
                <span>People that could make me sad,</span>
                <span>loves that were grand,</span>
                <span>flying high, never to land,</span>
                <span>experiences you could never think to plan,</span>
                <span>addictions in passion, I want to keep and have.</span>
                <span>The balance between living for now and after,</span>
                <span>I don't know if I can ever master.</span>
                <span>Building a life is too focused on my wants,</span>
                <span>Too much time to think on what I don't have,</span>
                <span>A painful glimpse of how the wants I once had slipped away.</span>
                <span>How can tomorrow be better, if it's gone today?</span>
                <span>I can't bear the planning, waiting, the effort,</span>
                <span>I always get hurt. By good people too.</span>
                <span>Id rather vehemently be happy right now,</span>
                <span>than live for a better tomorrow.</span>
